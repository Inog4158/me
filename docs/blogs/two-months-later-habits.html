<p>It has been about two months since my first blog post, and quite a lot has happened in between.<br>
To be completely honest, I also kind of forgot about this blog for a while.</p>
<h2>Habits and Experiments</h2>
<p>One of my main goals was to build a new habit: spaced repetition.
In short, spaced repetition is a learning technique where you review information at increasing time intervals. The idea is simple, you revisit things right before you would normally forget them, which makes learning more efficient and long-lasting.</p>
<p>In practice though, I quickly ran into a few problems.<br>
The biggest challenge was figuring out what I actually wanted to learn. Closely tied to that was the effort of creating physical flashcards. Deciding on topics, breaking them down, and writing new cards took more energy than I expected.</p>
<p>After almost a month, I paused this experiment. Not because spaced repetition does not work, but because my motivation to continuously create new cards slowly faded.</p>
<h2>Journaling</h2>
<p>I also tried journaling for a short time. I really enjoyed it, it helped me reflect and slow down at the end of the day.<br>
The downside was timing. Since I already tend to go to bed quite late, journaling often pushed my bedtime even further back, which was not ideal in the long run.</p>
<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
<p>Right now, I am mostly looking forward to the Christmas holidays.<br>
I have a few project ideas floating around in my head, but I will see where things go instead of forcing anything.</p>
<p>I wish you a wonderful Christmas, and thank you for reading.</p>
