<p>Hey</p>
<p>First off, I hope you started well into 2026 and enjoyed the Christmas holidays.
In the last month i dived into multiple new projects, here a summary of them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Coding own jarvis alike AI Helper</li>
<li>Building a Star Destroyer from a LEGO-like brand</li>
<li>Watching all 5 seasons of Stranger Things to watch the final episode at new year</li>
<li>Starting out with 2 Meshtastic nodes</li>
<li>Getting back into 3d printing</li>
</ul>
<p>The first goal i set to me is also related to this blog. Maybe you noticed but this is the first time I wrote the whole text by myself. I originally fed ChatGPT with my thoughts and it gave me a curated text. I noticed that i'm really not able to just write. Mails, messages or documentation i used AI for everything. So the first goal i set out for this year is to not use AI as much a possible and just write!</p>
<p>I'm also working continuously at the webpage and adding small features, like the for now hidden &quot;Radio Booth&quot;. In the next weeks im looking out to starting a new hobby, learning an instrument. For now i have the bass or an electric guitar in mind. I hope I will remember to update the blog more than once a month.</p>
<p>I wish you a nice day, and thank you for reading.</p>
