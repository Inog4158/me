Hey

First off, I hope you started well into 2026 and enjoyed the Christmas holidays.
In the last month i dived into multiple new projects, here a summary of them.

- Coding own jarvis alike AI Helper
- Building a Star Destroyer from a LEGO-like brand
- Watching all 5 seasons of Stranger Things to watch the final episode at new year
- Starting out with 2 Meshtastic nodes
- Getting back into 3d printing

The first goal i set to me is also related to this blog. Maybe you noticed but this is the first time I wrote the whole text by myself. I originally fed ChatGPT with my thoughts and it gave me a curated text. I noticed that i'm really not able to just write. Mails, messages or documentation i used AI for everything. So the first goal i set out for this year is to not use AI as much a possible and just write!

I'm also working continuously at the webpage and adding small features, like the for now hidden "Radio Booth". In the next weeks im looking out to starting a new hobby, learning an instrument. For now i have the bass or an electric guitar in mind. I hope I will remember to update the blog more than once a month.

I wish you a nice day, and thank you for reading.
